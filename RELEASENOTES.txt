Changes listed by release, then alphabetically.

CruiseControl Release Notes - 2.8.5-dev

general
======================
* Functional version of 'gendoc' -> configxml-gendoc.html generated from Java annotations contained in the plugin code. See plugins.html (http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/main/plugins.html) for more details (CC-202). Original patch by Jerome Lacoste, Rewritten annotation based impl by Seth Pollen, et al.
* Remove duplicates and missing jars from from eclipse .classpath (CC-1023). Patch by John Patrick.
* Change cruisecontrol.sh to check cc.pid and kill the start if the cc.pid is an active cruisecontrol instance that is already running (CC-1009). Patch by John Patrick.
* Update MX4J to version 3.0.2.
* Add ability to connect remote debugger - see: .ant-scripts/build-properties.xml -> remoteDebugJVMArgs
* Add new systemd service configuration - see: documentation/main/install.html
* Add support for inclusion of XML files using <xi:include href="something.xml" xpointer='element()'/>
* Use jdom 2 (jdom.2.0.6) library. It fixes a problem with split CData (see e.g. https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/pull/124)
* Configuration rework. The CC should now be able to start with (almost) empty launch.xml. There is a bit change in meaning of dist, proj, lib and home config options. See the related commit message for details
* Simple ${xxx} references can be used in launch.xml to refer other options, e.g. ${proj}/cruisecontrol.conf

build loop
======================
* Fix error in Builder.getBuildOutputConsumer() when live output is enabled and the project name contained a slash.
* StreamPumper changed to work with both text and binary data (CC-991). Patch by Daniel Tihelka.
* Fix FileResolver/ResolverUser to detect and re-read changed property files (CC-1043). Patch by Daniel Tihelka. 
* Configure environment variables in Builder (currently Ant, Maven2, and Exec) configuration (CC-1026). Patch by Daniel Tihelka.

Plugin
----------------------
* Adds from="" attribute simplifying the pre-configuration of plugins for the default CC tags
* Adds inherits="" attribute allowing to create simple hierarchical structure of plugins configuration

WriterBuilder
----------------------
* New builder which can write mesages to a file added. Written by Tomas Ausberger + Daniel Tihelka
  It is similar to ent's echo task, but it can be used in projects which do not rely on ant

PipedExecBuilder
----------------------
* Fix memory usage and logging volume issues with PipedExecBuilder (CC-991). Patch by Daniel Tihelka.
* Add support for gzipstdout and binarystdout to PipedExecBuilder (CC-991). Patch by Daniel Tihelka.
* Add repipe="" and disable="" attributes to allow change plugin-preconfigured pipes
* Refactoring of the builder - it now allows to plug 3rd party modules into the pipe. They only must
  implement PipedScript interface (with the optional use of PipedScriptBase helper class)
* To disable or re-pipe scrit, use new directives <repipe id="ID" pipefrom="new_pipe"/> (instead of <exec id="ID" repipe="new_pipe"/>) and <disable id="ID"/> (instead of <exec id="ID" disable="true"/>). It is more generic.
* Scripts may wait to more than one script when set by comma-separated values in <exec ... waitfor="A,B,C"/> attribute. The inner implementation also allows to be piped from more than one script, but it is (naturarly) not allowed for <exec ... /> scripts.

EmailPublisher
----------------------
* Include label in subject of build failure email (CC-1022). Patch by Quinn Styl.

ProjectStatus
----------------------
* New SourceControl module designed as the combination of <buildstatus/> (i.e. triggers when the depending project is built with success) and <veto /> (cancels the build when the depending project has modifications not built yet)


Dashboard
======================
* Fix build error in Dashboard on MacOSX due to java.io.tempdir name when converted to URI. (CC-976)
* Add missing icon image for "unknown" modification type (CC-799). Reported by John Prause.

 contrib
======================

distributed
----------------------
* Add BuildAgent Host Name info into remote build results, similar to how CompositeBuilder inserts child builder info.

documentation
======================
* Include main javadocs in website, as they are referenced from project docs, eg: main/plugins.html. Reported by Pavel Krusina.


CruiseControl Release Notes - 2.8.4

general
======================
* Fix binaryrelease/cruisecontrol.sh startup script to convert JETTY_LOGS variable when run under cygwin (CC-983). Patch by Mark Bretl.
* build script cleanups.

build loop
======================
* Add a JMX operation to retrieve build logs (CC-908). Adapted from patch by Ivan "Rambius" Ivanov. Tested by Antoine Levy Lambert.

Maven2Builder
----------------------

  This is affected by the addition of the 'LiveOutput' attribute to the base Builder class, therefore 'setShowBuildOutput' is actually deprecated, and 'setLiveOutput' should be used instead. See CC-911 for details.

PipedExecBuilder
----------------------
* Add new builder: Piped exec builder executes a list of exec builders (commands or scripts),
  where the STDIN of any number of the builders may be fed by STDOUT of a builder running under the piped exec builder. (CC-991). Patch by Daniel Tihelka

Dashboard
======================
* Add guard for NPE in BuildLoopQueryService, as per comment in CC-831. Suggested by David Williams.

* Update JSP reporting application to Servlet API 2.5 and JSP API 2.1
* Update Jetty to 6.1.11
* Extracted out the utility class ServerNameSingleton to avoid mulitple slow calls to get the host name.
* Add -log4jconfig command line property to specify URL (for example: "file:/c:/mylog4j.xml") to log4j configuration file.
* Update log4j to v1.2.15.
* Marked SelfConfiguringPlugin api as deprecated. We hope to remove the SelfConfiguringPlugin api soon (as it leads to more problems than it solves). If you really need the this api, please discuss why you need it on the user or dev lists (and hopefully we can find a way to use the standard plugin configuration instead.)

contrib
======================
* Move plugins that require external libraries to build out of cruisecontrol/main. They are now under cruisecontrol/contrib/plugins. Affected plugins include:
  - AllFusionHarvest
  - Sametime
  - StarTeam
  - Yahoo

distributed
----------------------
* Add distributed documentation to website
* Remove deprecated BuildAgentService.doBuild() methods.
* Added Lookup Services control feature to the Agent Utility. Allows you to stop a LookupService and it's ClassServer.
NOTE: We can always stop a LookupService, but the Swing Agent Utility can only stop the ClassServer on the localhost and the JMX Agent Utility can only stop the ClassServer on the host running the JMX server.

documentation
======================
* Composite builder does not support Pause builder child element (CC-812). Reported by John Camerin
* Add documentation on "Building Plugins That Need External Libraries".
* Have documentation served by Jetty as part of the binary release, context of "documentation".

build loop
======================

ArtifactsPublisher
---------------------
* Add option to move instead of copy artifacts which can save time (CC-833). Patch by Grzegorz Oledzki.

BuildStatus
---------------------
* Add attribute 'vetoIfFailing'. Will abort the build if the project being monitored had the last build fail (CC-842).

CMSynergy
---------------------
* Allow reconfiguring of "system testing", "insulated development" purpose-based projects. Patch by David Corley

CMSynergyBaselineBootstrapper
---------------------
* New plugin for creating new baselines prior to building (CC-862). Submitted by David Corely

CompositeBuilder
---------------------
* Improve processing of build results to make it faster with large log files (CC-826). Patch by David Webster.

CruiseControlConfig
---------------------
* LabelIncrementers are no longer special cased, they are now treated like any other plugin. They must now be added to a project to get a non-default label incrementer and they can be registered with any name; are no longer forced to be named 'labelincrementer'. You can no longer set the labelincrementer classname via JMX. This change is not backwards compatible for users that were registering an alternative label incrementer but not placing the <labelincrementer> element in each project.

CVS
---------------------
* Add attribute "skipEmailsFetching" for people who don't have CVSROOT/users and don't want the (harmless) messages in the log when that file isn't found (CC-841). Patch by Grzegorz Oledzki
* Add attribute 'recurseLocalWorkingCopy' which allows localWorkingCopy to point at a directory not under version control; reduces effort when project has multiple projects in parallel directories under a non-versioned root (CC-820). Based on patch by Detlef Keil.

Darcs
---------------------
* Fix Darcs support (CC-847). Patch by Marc Fontaine.

DateFormat
---------------------
* The ability to set the date format in the build loop has been removed. If you are using this element (<dateformat>) in your configuration file you will need to remove it. This fixes the issue where setting the date format on one project would affect all of them (CC-355), would cause build status messages to not display in the reporting application (CC-797). Build loop now uses ISO 8601 format for storing date stamp information (CC-353) which is a change from the previous default format.

FileSystem
----------------------
* If includedirectories="true" checks for modifications to directories since the last build, and as a result, will show modification if any files were deleted (CC-861). Patch by Guanglei Li.

JMX
----------------------
* Add JMXBuildAgentUtility to control panel. Only loads if DistCC classes are available on the CC classpath. Use "-agentutil false" command line option to disable automatic loading of JMX Build Agent Utility.

Mercurial
---------------------
* a new attribute "hgcommand" for the <mercurial> source control plugin, which has two options: "incoming" or "log". Use "log" to use <mercurial> and <mercurialbootstrapper> together (CC-864). Patch by Guanglei Li.

ModificationSet
---------------------
* When there are multiple source controls attempt to merge conflicting properties by choosing the 'largest' value, to address situation where multiple source controls should return the newest version number or date (CC-830).

Schedule
---------------------
* Fixed a bug where time builders could be hidden by a multiple builder earlier in the file (CC-839). Now Builders are evaluated by time, then by multiple and then by day.
* Fixed a bug related to adjusting for a pause at the end of Daylight Savings Time (CC-863).

ScriptRunner
---------------------
* Change ScriptRunner/AntBuilder to only create antBuilderOutput.log when needed. Reported by Jared Tafralian.

TFS
---------------------
* Add attributes to support connections profiles and non-default encodings (CC-853). Patch by Dmitry Malenok.

UCM
---------------------
* Logging contributor activities in UCM Modificationset throws a NullPointerException on Linux Platform (CC-815). Path by Patrick Jenner.

reporting jsp app
======================
* Display file size and date on artifacts page (CC-731). Patch by Doug Berkland.
* Change look and feel to be more similar to documentation.

Dashboard
======================
* Fix bug where tests that took > 1000 seconds would cause an exception that prevented the build detail page from displaying (CC-828).
* Added ability for users to override the maximum artifact file size that can be viewed without downloading by setting the context parameter 'download.threshhold' (CC-821).

CruiseControl Release Notes - 2.7.3

general
======================
* Change cruisecontrol.sh (main, binaryrelease, distcc) script to use more generic shebang (that also works on FreeBSD) (CC-789). Patch by Ivan "Rambius" Ivanov

* Update bundled cc-config to version 1.8.

build loop
======================

ClearCase
---------------------
* Change cleartool command line to always use date in US format, ignoring the language set in the operating System (CC-818). Patch by Jean-Philippe HAUTIN.

ClearCaseViewstrapper
---------------------
* ClearCaseViewStrapper would cancel the build if the view was already mounted (CC-757).  Reported by Gerrit Brehmer. Patch by Glenn Opdycke-Hansen.

CMSynergy
---------------------
* Now throws exception when contacting the server fails. This will abort the build rather than continuing with potentially incomplete or incorrect information.

ExecBuilder
---------------------
* Improve error message when there are no arguments.
* Substitute properites in arguments (like ${label} or ${projectname})
* Error lines reported by an external script are now injected into the build log (CC-763). Patch by Adrian Spinei.

Origo Publisher
----------------------
* Add Publisher for the Origo collaboration platform (CC-775). Patch by Patrick Ruckstuhl.

ProjectConfig
----------------------
* ProjectConfig.toString() should return Project.toString() to avoid breaking external jmx scripts. Reported by Mark Hatton.
* Add forceBuildNewProject attribute. Setting to false will not attempt to build if the .SER file is missing (CC-380). Reported by Greg Gipson, Patch by Spencer Smith.

SSCM/SSCMBootstrapper
----------------------
* Change Surround sourcecontrol and bootstrapper to use CommandLine() classes (CC-786). Patch by Alex Hooper.

* Insert composite builder info into build log for each child builder.
Todo: Rearranging these elements (even nesting childLog elements?), might allow display of these child buider info elements in reporting apps.
* Implement (and document) "timeout" attribute.

Configuration documentation generation
