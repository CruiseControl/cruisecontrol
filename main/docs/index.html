<span class="header">The CruiseControl Build Loop</span>
<p>

<span class="small">What Is It?</span><br>

The Build Loop is designed to run as a daemon process which will periodically check your source control tool for
changes to your codebase, build if necessary, and send out a notification regarding the status of the build.

<p>
<span class="small">How Does It Work?</span><br>
CruiseControl defines a build cycle - determine if a build is necessary, build, create a log file, and send
notifications.  The daemon
process will wake up at a user defined time interval and attempt a build cycle.  Each time, the configuration file
will be reloaded so that the CruiseControl process need not be restarted for the changes to take effect.  At the end
of the build, a log file will be written for use by the Build Results JSP.

<p>&nbsp;<p>

<span class="header">New Features</span><p>

<p>
<span class="small">XML Configuration</span><br>
Defining the configuration for CruiseControl in XML has allowed us freedoms that were not easily possible
with the old properties file.

<p>
<span class="small">Runs standard Ant build files</span><br>
CruiseControl now runs as a true wrapper to Ant and no longer requires any changes to your existing build file
to run.

<p>
<span class="small">Pluggable Architecture</span><br>
CruiseControl is easier to customize now that almost all of the non-core functionality is
implemented as plugins.  See the <a href="">plugins</a> page for more details about the plugin philosophy and
the <a href="">config.xml</a> page for more details about the stock plugins that ship with CruiseControl.

<p>
<span class="small">Better Scheduling Functionality</span><br>
Schedule as many different builds as you like, run at an interval or scheduled at a given time.

<p>
<span class="small">HTML email support</span><br>
View the build results directly on the notification emails rather than linking to the build results JSP.

<p>
<span class="small">Upgrade utility for migrating from 1.x to 2.0</span><br>
Relatively painless upgrading if you have an earlier version of CruiseControl installed.  Run the included
Upgrader and be ready to run 2.0 almost instantaneously.

<p>
<span class="small">Better Memory Management</span><br>
The CruiseControl 1.x product line was plagued by memory leaks.  Most should be plugged now, and the decoupling
from Ant should make sure that CruiseControl's memory usage should not grow over time.

<!--
<p>
<span class="small">Better support for CVS Branching</span><br>
Previous versions of CruiseControl had issues with returning all modifications, regardless of the branch on which
they occurred.

<p>
<span class="small">Internationalization</span><br>
As our user base has grown, we need to be aware of issues that occur when CruiseControl is run in non-US locales.
Configuring date formats has become simpler, for instance.
