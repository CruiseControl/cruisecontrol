<p class="small">Help Wanted</p>

The CruiseControl Project can use your help.  Following are suggestions for features.  Submissions and additional
feature requests should be directed to the cruisecontrol-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.<p>

<span class="small">To Do List:</span>

<p><span class="small">Multiple projects</span><br/>
<ol>
	<li>Support multiple projects from a single CruiseControl instance; no project dependencies</li>
	<li>Handle project dependencies</li>
	<li>Reporting supports displaying build results from multiple projects using one webapp</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><span class="small">Runtime management</span><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Force a build at any time without having to bounce CruiseControl</li>
	<li>Stop a currently running build without having to kill CruiseControl</li>
	<li>Define build process in a more user friendly environment</li>
	<li>See the state of CC.  Example: "Is it in the test phase now? or in the check repos phase?"</li>
	<li>Pull config.xml changes from version control before a build</li>
	<li>Store dynamic changes into version controlled config.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="small">SourceControl Unit Tests</span><br>
CruiseControl supports interactions with multiple source control tools.  Unfortunately, our unit tests are
a bit under developed.  Most of our source control wrappers just parse the output from the command line, so
capturing that output to a text file gives us input that we can use for our unit tests.  Building our unit tests
around this will help us to manage changes between versions, locales, etc.
<p>
<span class="small">JMX Control Panel JSP</span><br>
CruiseControl has the ability to be started/stopped remotely via JMX extensions.  Since
the beginning, people have suggested that there be an option to start/stop builds from
the jsp.  Ideally, we'd have a controlpanel.jsp that would enable this.
<p>
<span class="small">TextEmailPublisher</span><br>
Currently, CruiseControl has the feature of sending an email notification.  Currently this
email message is limited to a link to the build results JSP.  Having a brief text summary in
the body of the email has been suggested.  See publishers.EmailPublisher and publishers.LinkEmailPublisher.
<p>
<span class="small">SCM Bootstrappers</span><br>
A Bootstrapper is an action that is run before a build.  Since the build.xml file is
responsible for checking out code, there will be issues if the build.xml file itself
has been modified.  What we'd like to see is a collection of Bootstrappers for each
supported source control tool.  Each would be responsible for checking out/updating
a single file.
<p>
<span class="small">Documentation</span><br>
A project is only as good as it's documentation.  If any inconsistencies/inaccuracies
are found, please report them to us.  Any other suggestions for improvement are
encouraged as well.
