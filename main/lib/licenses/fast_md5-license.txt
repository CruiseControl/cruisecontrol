The original Ant build file was kindly contributed by Dannes Wessels.
I (Tim Macinta) haven't done much testing of it, but I thought it
would be good to provide here as a convenience to others that might
have use for it.  Please feel free to send back any enhancements you
might make to it or any feedback you may have.  I have made some minor
changes, but it is very close to the original as of this writing.

Note that there is a also Makefile for Linux in the "src/" directory.
