# CruiseControl configuration tuning
#
# Be careful when using quotes, since the config is designed to be compatible
# with systemd init daemon (man systemd)
#
# Also note that all relative paths to files or directories are relative to the
# cruisecontrol's home directory (see CRUISE_USER option)
#
# The installer must replace the following macros by the approriate values:
#  - CRUISE_DIR - the path where CC was installed


# The username under which cruisecontrol system runs. The cruisecontrol daemon
# runs in the home directory of the user!
#
# !!!!! BE CAREFUL:
# setting user through this variable does now work with systemd v.189 and below!
# Override User= option in /etc/systemd/system/cruisecontrol.service if necessary
#CRUISE_USER=cruise
# The path to directory where the cruisecontrol was installed
CRUISE_DIR=/usr/share/cruisecontrol

# Other cruisecontrol options (see http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/gettingstartedbindist.html#Command_Line_Options)
CRUISE_OPTS=-configfile ./CC.config.xml -log4jconfig ./log4j.properties -webapppath $CRUISE_DIR/webapps/cruisecontrol -dashboard $CRUISE_DIR/webapps/dashboard

# Options passed to Java (with some related to cruisecontrol as well)
