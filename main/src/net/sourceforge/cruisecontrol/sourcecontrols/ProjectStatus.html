<p>Used to trigger a build when another CruiseControl project has a
successful build. If configured, it will also check if the another
project is up to date and vetos the build attempt if it is not.</p>
<p>The module works as the combination of 
<a href="#buildstatus">&lt;buildstatus&gt;</a> and 
<a href="#veto">&lt;veto&gt;</a> modules with significantly easier 
configuration.</p>

<p>When the build is triggered, this will report the list of
modifications of the monitored project, having <i>username</i> set
to "cc-" + the name of the monitored project. Moreover, the list is
prepended with additional modification "buildstatus" element
summarizing the modification request: the <i>username</i> set (again)
to "cc-" + the name of the monitored project, <i>revision</i> set to
the label of its newest build and <i>modifiedTime</i> set to the date
of its newest build. You may need make an alias for this 
<i>username</i> if you are using an <a href="#email">&lt;email&gt;</a>
publisher.</p>


<h3>How the veto of build works</h3>

<p>If project <i>bar</i> (embedding &lt;projectstatus&gt; element in 
<a href="#modificationset">&lt;modificationset&gt;</a>) depends on
project <i>foo</i> then the build of <i>bar</i> is triggered only
after the previous successful build of <i>foo</i>. However, if
there is a change in the
<a href="#modificationset">&lt;modificationset&gt;</a> of
<i>foo</i> that would cause another build of <i>foo</i> (i.e. making
it out-of-date), the build of <i>bar</i> is canceled as long as the
<i>foo</i> is built correctly and no other modification is queued in
the <i>foo</i>.</p>


<h3>Properties passed to the Builders</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard CruiseControl <a href="#buildproperties">
properties passed to builders</a>, &lt;projectstatus&gt; sets the
following properties:</p>

<table class="documentation">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>most.recent.logdir</td>
        <td>The location when log files of the monitored project are
        stored</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>most.recent.logfile</td>
        <td>The name of the newest (successful) logfile of the monitored
        project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>most.recent.logtime</td>
        <td>The timestamp of the newest build included in the
        "buildstatus" modification element, under <i>modifiedTime</i>,
        using the format <code>yyyyMMddHHmmss</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>most.recent.loglabel</td>
        <td>The label of the newest build (included in the
        "buildstatus" modification element, under <i>revision</i> 
        tag.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
