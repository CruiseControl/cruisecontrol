<p>The <code>&lt;property&gt;</code> element is used to set a property (or set of properties)
within the CruiseControl configuration file. Properties may be set at the global level
and/or within the scope of a project. There are three ways to set properties within CruiseControl:</p>
<ol>
    <li>By supplying both the name and value attributes.</li>
    <li>By setting the file attribute with the filename of the property file to load.
        This property file must follow the format defined by the class java.util.Properties,
        with the same rules about how non-ISO8859-1 characters must be escaped.</li>
    <li>By setting the environment attribute with a prefix to use. Properties will be defined
        for every environment variable by prefixing the supplied name and a period to the name
        of the variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>Properties in CruiseControl are <i>not entirely</i> immutable: whoever sets a property <i>last</i>
will freeze it's value <i>within the scope in which the property was set</i>. In other words,
you may define a property at the global level, then eclipse this value within the scope of a single
project by redefining the property within that project. You may not, however, set a property more
than once within the same scope. If you do so, only the last assignment will be used.</p>

<p>Just as in Ant, the value part of a property being set may contain references to other properties.
These references are resolved at the time these properties are set. This also holds for properties
loaded from a property file, or from the environment.</p>

<p>Also note that the property <code>${project.name}</code> is set for you automatically and will always resolve
to the name of the project currently being serviced - even outside the scope of the project
definition.</p>

<p>Finally, note that properties bring their best when combined with
