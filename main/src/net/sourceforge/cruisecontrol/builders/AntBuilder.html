<p>Specifies an Ant build to be run at a given time or build number.
For instance, we can run a clean build every 5 builds, or run more
comprehensive (and time intensive) system tests every 10 builds.  We
can also schedule an official build to run every night at midnight,
if we so desire.</p>

<p>When a build runs, Ant is invoked in a separate Java process. There
are two alternative ways in which ant may be invoked:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Using the <strong><code>antscript</code></strong>, or <strong><code>anthome</code></strong>, attribute (preferred)
    helps to ensure that builds are run
    completely independent of the CruiseControl distribution, and that
    extra jars required in the ant lib-directory need not be duplicated
    within CruiseControl.</li>
    <li>Using the ant binaries distributed with CruiseControl. Settings
    for the virtual machine can be specified using the nested <code>
    &lt;jvmarg&gt;</code> element. This also requires that java be on
    the executable path.</li>
</ol>

<p>The standard CruiseControl <a href="#buildproperties">properties
passed to builders</a> are available from within the ant build.</p>

<p>See below for <a href="#ant-examples">examples</a> of the
<code>&lt;ant&gt;</code> element.</p>
