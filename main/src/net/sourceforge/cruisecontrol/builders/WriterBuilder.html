<p>The example stores the given texts into <tt>C:\Projects\data\message.txt</tt> in CP1250 encoding.
The output consists of texts from the first &lt;msg&gt;...&lt;/msg&gt; element, followed by
the content of <tt>C:\Projects\data\nums.txt</tt> (being originally in Latin2 encoding), and
followed by the content if the second &lt;msg&gt;...&lt;/msg&gt; element:
    <pre>&lt;writer file="C:\Projects\data\message.txt" encoding="cp1250" trim="true"&gt;
    &lt;msg&gt;This example copies the content of file,
         just after this text, including the empty line following this intro message:
    &lt;/msg&gt;
    &lt;file file="C:\Projects\data\nums.txt" encoding="latin2"/&gt;
    &lt;msg&gt;
         And after another empty line, there will be this text concluding
         everything.&lt;/msg&gt;
&lt;/writer&gt;</pre></p>

<p>Supposing that the content of <tt>C:\Projects\data\default</tt> file looks like (including the spaces):<pre>   1 2 3 4 5
   6 7 8 9</pre> the content of the output file will look like:<pre>This example copies the content of file,
just after this text, including the empty line following this intro message:
               
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
 
And after another empty line, there will be this text concluding
everything.</pre></p>
