 * The property should be added to the set of properties returned by the {@link #getProperties()} call.
 * Allows the underlying build script to do conditional actions if the files watched by this

 * name of property to define if a deletion is detected.
 * The property should be added to the set of properties returned by the {@link #getProperties()} call.
