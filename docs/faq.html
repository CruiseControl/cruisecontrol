<span class="small"><a name="whyupgrade">Why should I upgrade to CruiseControl 2.0?</a></span>
    <p>
CruiseControl has been pretty much rewritten from the 1.2.x line to the 2.0 line.  A more pluggable
architecture has been implemented.  There's better test coverage.  XML configuration is more
flexible.  See the <a href="../main/docs/index.html">build loop page</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
<span class="small"><a name="nojunit">Why don't my jUnit results show up on the web page?</a></span>
    <p>
Perhaps the JUnit results are not being captured correctly.
Ensure that your &lt;junit&gt; ant task contains the proper formatting directive to
instruct JUnit to output the results in XML format: &lt;formatter type="xml"/&gt;.
If you are directing JUnit to send output to a subdirectory, make sure to tell
CC about it - use the &lt;merge&gt; element in the &lt;log&gt; section of your config.xml.
    </p>

<span class="small"><a name="toomuchrepository">What does "Too much repository activity" mean?</a></span>
    <p>
This means there is currently code being committed to the repository, and CC
is afraid of doing a build that may potentially contain partial check-ins. CC
will not kick off a build until it is sure that a developer is done committing
code. CC uses the "quietperiod" setting to determine the amount of time it
should wait after the last commit before doing a build. If you get this
message in your CC log and not many builds are run, you may want to lower your
"quietperiod" setting to a smaller time value.
    </p>
    <p>
The amount of time that CruiseControl waits is based on the <nobr>(quietperiod - (now - checkin time)).</nobr>  If we are only 5
seconds away from the end of the quiet period, we'll just wait that long rather than waiting for the full quiet
period.  Some issues may arise if the clocks are not synchronized between the CruiseControl machine and the CVS
machine -- you might get large/odd sleep times if the CVS machine is ahead of the CruiseControl machine.

<span class="small"><a name="nocontentjsp">Why does my jsp page show the build and dates, but the right half of the page is blank no matter what I click on?</a></span>
    <p>
Your xml log file encoding is incorrect.
CC puts the JVM system encoding at the top of every xml log file that it
generates, and the xsl tranformer on your system is not happy transforming
that specific encoding. Use the "encoding" parameter of the "log" entry in the
config.xml to override the xml encoding name. Try "UTF-8" or "ISO-8859-1".

<span class="small"><a name="nullnav">Why does my jsp page show "null" instead of build names and dates?</a></span>
    <p>
There were issues with some JSP containers with respect to reusing instances of the custom tags.  This has been
fixed in CVS and is part of the 2.1 release.

<span class="small"><a name="JAVA_HOME.ignored">Why is my JAVA_HOME environment variable being ignored?</a></span>

	<p>Usually this problem manifests itself like:</p>

	<pre>My CruiseControl builds are failing because ant can't use the modern java
	compiler and my project won't compile with the classic compiler.  But my
	JAVA_HOME env var is set properly--in fact I can run the various ant targets
	myself just fine.</pre>

	<p>Usually this is because tools.jar is not in the CLASSPATH. It's worth noting here
	that the Ant scripts pick up JAVA_HOME and add tools.jar to the classpath automatically.
	However, at the time of writing, CruiseControl does not.</p>

	<p>The main reason for this is that, if you are not using the classic or modern
	compilers, you don't need it. Furthermore, due to problems with javac
	locking JAR files, it is advisable to use a different compiler (such as
	Jikes).</p>

    <hr width="90%">
    <p>
<span class="small"><a name="JAVA_HOME.ignored">How do I deal with javac locking jars if I can't switch to jikes?</a></span>

	<p>This solution requires Ant 1.4.  Set the property "build.compiler" to "extJavac".
	This tells Ant to fork a separate process for using Javac, which will release the lock when it terminates.
	Alternatively, set the "fork" attribute of the javac task to true.</p>

    <hr width="90%">
    <p>
<span class="small"><a name="servletVersion">DefaultServletConfig does not implement interface javax.servlet.ServletConfig?</a></span>

	<p>Usually this problem manifests itself with an Exception containing text similar to this:</p>

	<pre>DefaultServletConfig does not implement interface javax.servlet.ServletConfig</pre>

	<p>The solution to this is normaly very simple. Remove servlet.jar from your WEB-INF/lib directory.
	The reason for it being there in the first place is probably because you copied all files in the lib
	directory to your WEB-INF. Should be fixed later on with somewhat more organized release builds.</p>

    <p>
<span class="small"><a name="noCompileErrors">Why don't javac compilation errors show up on the web page?</a></span>

    <p>The CruiseControl XSL was developed and tested against Ant 1.3.  If you have an older version of CruiseControl,
    you may need to modify the XSL so that CruiseControl can correctly transform the build log.<p>
    Abraham Alvarez and Scot Doyle did a very good job of summing up the <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/10938/2002/4/0/8468120/">issues</a> on the mailing list.

    <hr width="90%">
    <p>
<span class="small"><a name="cantSearch">How can I search the mailing lists?</a></span>

    <p>
    The GeoCrawler mailing list archive doesn't allow searching.  However, the SF Mail Archive does allow searching.

<span class="small"><a name="howtohelp">How do I submit bugs/patches/features?</a></span>

    <p>
Send patches to the <a href="">cruisecontrol-devel</a> mailing list.  Ideally patches should be a diff
against the existing CVS version and should provide unit tests.  If you're adding new features, an informal
use case is useful so that others can quickly understand the utility of your patch.
