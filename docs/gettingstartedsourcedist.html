        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This guide covers the steps involved in getting CruiseControl up
        and running from scratch. It intentionally avoids providing an initial,
        fill-in-the-blanks template, but instead discusses each feature in turn,
        to try and provide a better understanding of how everything works.</p>

        <h2><a name="Before_you_Start">Before you Start</a></h2>

        <p>This guide assumes that you already have a working project with
        the following features:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>the project can be built with a single target of a supported
            build tool. The build target should perform all of the build steps
            for your project, including compiling, building jars, running tests,
            and generating the full software distribution.</li>
            <li>the project code is under version control of a supported version
            control tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The rest of this guide assumes that the build tool is Ant, and the
        version control system is CVS. CruiseControl also supports Maven and
        NAnt as alternative builders, as well as more than ten other version
        control products. Refer to the <a href="../main/docs/configxml.html">
        Configuration Reference</a> for more information.</p>

        <p>This guide also assumes that there is a single output file from the
        build (for example, a zip file containing all of your jars, reports,
        documentation, and so on). Once you've got the simple things working,
        you'll be able to customize your build to suit your needs.</p>

        <h2><a name="Install_CruiseControl">Install And Build CruiseControl</a></h2>

        <p>First, <a href="download.html">download CruiseControl</a>. Unzip
        this file to your applications directory. The top-level directory
        created when you unzipped this file will be referred to as
        <code>INSTALL_DIR</code>.</p>

        <p>There are four directories under <code>INSTALL_DIR</code>. These
        are:</p>

        <table class="documentation">
            <tr>
                <th>Directory</th>
                <th>Contents</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>docs</code></td>
                <td>A copy of the website found at
                <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">
                         http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/</a>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>contrib</code></td>
                <td>Scripts and utilities contributed to CruiseControl, but
                not officially supported as part of the main distribution.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>main</code></td>
                <td>The build loop, which is a Java application that provides
                the core build scheduling functionality of CruiseControl.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>reporting</code></td>
                <td>The reporting application, which is a J2EE web application
                for showing build results</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>To build the CruiseControl jars you will need to execute the Ant
        build scripts in <code>INSTALL_DIR/main</code> and
        <code>INSTALL_DIR/reporting</code>. These build scripts not only compile
        the code but also run the unit tests and then package the output.
        Occasionally people encounter environment specific failures when the unit
        tests run (such as not having java on the executable path). While these
        failures should be reported to the mailing list so that the tests can be
        fixed typically the failing test can be safely deleted to allow the build
        to complete.</p>

        <p>To confirm that the installation is consistent, start a command
        shell and run the following command (make sure you replace
        <code>INSTALL_DIR</code> with the actual installation directory):</p>

        <pre>java -jar INSTALL_DIR/main/dist/cruisecontrol-launcher.jar</pre>

        <p>You should get a "No config file" message, along with usage details,
        and a cruisecontrol.log file will be created in the current directory.
        This means that CruiseControl is correctly installed and ready to run
        (given a valid configuration file).</p>

        <p>The remaining examples require <code>INSTALL_DIR/bin</code> to be
        added to the system path.</p>

        <h2><a name="Running_the_Build_Loop">Running the Build Loop</a></h2>

        <h3><a name="Setup_a_Working_Area">Setup a Working Area</a></h3>

        <p>Now you need to set up your CruiseControl working directories, and
        create a configuration file. These should be placed in a separate
        directory to <code>INSTALL_DIR</code>, as they contain your data, as
        opposed to CruiseControl code. This will simplify later CruiseControl
        upgrades.</p>

        <p>As an example, you might create a working directory
        <code>/work/cruise</code>. This will be referred to as
        <code>WORK_DIR</code> for the remainder of this guide.</p>

        <p>Create three subdirectories underneath <code>WORK_DIR</code>:</p>

        <table class="documentation">
            <tr>
                <th>Directory</th>
                <th>Contents</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>checkout</code></td>
                <td>This is where CruiseControl checks out your project from
                version control.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>logs</code></td>
                <td>This is where CruiseControl will write its build
                reports.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>artifacts</code></td>
                <td>This is where CruiseControl can put any build output files
                that need to be kept.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Note that we're setting up CruiseControl to take advantage of the
        multi-project support. Although this adds a tiny bit of complexity to
        the process, it will make it a lot easier when you later want to add
        another project to your continuous integration.</p>

        <p>This directory structure works quite well in practice, but it is
        possible to have a very different directory structure than the one
        described here. The paths to these directories are all specified in the
        configuration files.</p>

        <h3><a name="Checkout_a_Project">Checkout a Project</a></h3>

        <p>Manually checkout the CVS module for the project you want to build
        into <code>WORK_DIR/checkout</code>. We will refer to your project name
        as <code>MY_PROJECT_1</code>, and assume that the CVS module has the
        same name. There will now be a directory called
        <code>WORK_DIR/checkout/MY_PROJECT_1</code>.</p>

        <h3><a name="Create_a_Delegating_Build_Script">Create a Delegating Build Script</a></h3>

        <p>Create a new Ant script called <code>build-MY_PROJECT_1.xml</code> in
        <code>WORK_DIR</code> as follows:</p>

        <pre>&lt;!-- Delegating build script, used by cruisecontrol to build MY_PROJECT_1.
     Note that the basedir is set to the checked out project --&gt;
&lt;project name="build-MY_PROJECT_1"
        default="build"
        basedir="checkout/MY_PROJECT_1"&gt;
    &lt;target name="build"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Get the latest from CVS --&gt;
        &lt;cvs command="up -d -P"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- Call the target that does everything --&gt;
        &lt;ant antfile="build.xml" target="build-everything"/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

        <p>This is a delegating build script, which cruise will run to build
        your project. Basically, this build script should just call through to
        your project build file <code>WORK_DIR/checkout/MY_PROJECT_1/build.xml</code>,
        as well as performing extra steps which are specific to the
        CruiseControl build, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>getting the latest sources from version control</li>
            <li>tagging the version control tree after a successful build</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Of course, if your build already does this, you won't need to add
        these commands to the delegating build script. It is even possible to
        bypass the delegating build script completely and configure
        CruiseControl to directly invoke the project build script.</p>

        <p>The build label is passed in to the script as a property named
        "label". Simply use <code>${label}</code> in the ant script. For an
        overview of all properties passed to your build script, see the
        <a href="../main/docs/configxml.html#buildproperties">Properties Passed
        To The Builders</a> section in the Configuration Reference.</p>

        <h3><a name="Configure_the_Build_Loop">Configure the Build Loop</a></h3>

        <p>By default, CruiseControl looks for a configuration file named
        <code>config.xml</code> in the current directory. Create the file
        <code>WORK_DIR/config.xml</code> as follows:</p>

        <pre>&lt;cruisecontrol&gt;
&lt;/cruisecontrol&gt;</pre>

        <p>Try running CruiseControl from within <code>WORK_DIR</code>. That is,
        start a command shell, cd to <code>WORK_DIR</code>, type the following
        command and press enter:</p>

        <p>Windows:</p>
        <pre>INSTALL_DIR/main/bin/cruisecontrol.bat</pre>

        <p>Unix:</p>
        <pre>INSTALL_DIR/main/bin/cruisecontrol.sh</pre>

        <p>CruiseControl should start up correctly, stating "BuildQueue started".
        However, to get CruiseControl to actually do anything, you'll need to
        configure a project.</p>

        <p>It is possible to run CruiseControl from another location, and
        specify the path to <code>config.xml</code> using the
        <code>-configfile</code> command-line option. Be warned: the paths in
        your config file are relative to the current directory, and not relative
        to the config file itself.</p>

        <p>Modify <code>config.xml</code> to look like the following. The
        meaning of each of the elements is explained below.</p>

        <pre style="line-height: 18px;">&lt;cruisecontrol&gt;
  &lt;project name="MY_PROJECT_1" buildafterfailed="true"<sup><a name="1" href="#buildafterfailed">1</a></sup>&gt;

          file="logs/MY_PROJECT_1/status.txt"/&gt;
    &lt;/listeners&gt;

    &lt;!-- Bootstrappers are run every time the build runs,
        *before* the modification checks --&gt;
    &lt;bootstrappers&gt;
    &lt;/bootstrappers&gt;

    &lt;/modificationset&gt;

    &lt;publishers&gt;<sup><a name="8" href="#publishers">8</a></sup>
    &lt;/publishers&gt;
  &lt;/project&gt;
&lt;/cruisecontrol&gt;</pre>

        <p>Explanation of configuration:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>1: <a href="#1" name="buildafterfailed"><code>buildafterfailed="true"</code></a></dt>
            <dd>The "buildafterfailed" property tells CruiseControl if it should
            keep on trying to build, even if the last time failed and there have
            been no changes. The good thing about this is that if the build
            failed because a database server was unavailable, or some other
            transient problem, the next attempt might succeed. The bad thing is
            that if there is a real problem with the source in version control,
            cruise will just keep on trying to build until you commit a fix for
            the problem.</dd>

            <dt>2: <a href="#2" name="currentbuildstatuslistener"><code>&lt;currentbuildstatuslistener&gt;</code></a></dt>
            <dd>This element tells CruiseControl the name of a file where it can
            write notes about its current activity. This file is required by the
            reporting application, so we configure it here. For multi-project
            configs it is probably easiest to place it in the project logs
            directory, as above. This listener writes messages such as "Current
            Build Started At: [date]" to this file.</dd>

            <dt>3: <a href="#3" name="modificationset"><code>&lt;modificationset&gt;</code></a></dt>
            <dd>This element configures how CruiseControl checks for changes in
            the version control repository, to determine if a build should be
            attempted. The example given tells CruiseControl to use CVS to check
            for changes in it's local working copy of the module which you checked
            out earlier.</dd>

            <dt>4: <a href="#4" name="quietperiod"><code>quietperiod="10"</code></a></dt>
            <dd>The "quietperiod" attribute tells CruiseControl not to try to
            build while the version control repository is being actively
            updated. Instead, CruiseControl waits until it sees a period of
            quiet in the repository before doing a build. If you're committing
            files individually to version control, CruiseControl will wait until
            you've finished, as long as you don't take longer than the specified
            quietperiod between commits. It is specified in seconds.</dd>

            <dt>5: <a href="#5" name="schedule"><code>&lt;schedule&gt;</code></a></dt>
            <dd>The <code>&lt;schedule&gt;</code> element sets up the build-loop
            for your project, with the "interval" attribute telling cruise how
            many seconds to sleep in between polling for changes. With the
            <code>interval="60"</code> and <code>quietperiod="10"</code>
            attributes, CruiseControl will check for modifications in version
            control every 60 seconds. If modifications were made in the 10
            seconds before the check, cruise will wait until a 10 second window
            with no changes is found. Once this happens, cruise will kick off
            the Ant build. These values are probably a bit low for the real
            world, but they are OK for getting started.</dd>

            <dt>6: <a href="#6" name="ant"><code>&lt;ant&gt;</code></a></dt>
            <dd>This element tells CruiseControl which Ant build file to run,
            and which target. The uselogger and usedebug elements together tell
            cruise not to write Ant debug statements to the build logs, which
            can make them much smaller.</dd>

        </dl>

        <h3><a name="Start_the_Build_Loop">Start the Build Loop</a></h3>

        <p>If you now run CruiseControl from <code>WORK_DIR</code>, you should
        see it start. To kick off a build, you may need to commit changes to
        version control (not from the <code>WORK_DIR/checkout/MY_PROJECT_1</code>
        workspace, but from another location). If the build fails, CruiseControl
        will keep on trying, until you get it right. You don't need to restart
        CruiseControl if you change <code>config.xml</code> or your delegating
        build file, since cruise reloads these every time a build is
        performed.</p>

        <p>If you look in <code>WORK_DIR/logs/MY_PROJECT_1</code>, you'll see
        the cruise build reports, which are XML files. Any file that looks
        similar to <code>build.?.xml</code> indicates a successful build, while
        other XML files indicate failures. Fortunately, you don't need to parse
        these files yourself, because both the web reporting application and the
        HTML Email publisher distributed with CruiseControl can present these
        results in HTML format. But for now, you're up and running, and every
        time you commit to version control, CruiseControl will pick up those
        changes and build them.</p>

        <h3><a name="Reporting_Build_Status_via_Email">Reporting Build Status
        via Email</a></h3>

        <p>A good way to keep track of your continuous integration is by
        receiving emails, either for every build, or just for the ones that
        fail. This is done by adding an <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> publisher to
        the set of publishers.</p>

        <p>The most basic email functionality sends emails to one set of
        addresses on every single build (success or failure), and another set
        of addresses just on failed builds. To set this up, add an element like
        this inside the <code>&lt;publishers&gt;</code> element:</p>

        <pre>&lt;email mailhost="SMTP_HOST"
        returnaddress="cruise@mydomain.com"
        buildresultsurl="http://localhost/cc/buildresults/MY_PROJECT_1"
        skipusers="true" spamwhilebroken="true"&gt;
    &lt;always address="dev1@mydomain.com"/&gt;
    &lt;always address="dev2@mydomain.com"/&gt;
    &lt;failure address="failed-builds@mydomain.com"/&gt;
&lt;/email&gt;</pre>

        <p>In this example, there are two addresses that will always receive
        build notifications, and another that will only receive notifications
        when the build fails.</p>

        <p>If you also want individual committers to receive email for all
        builds where they made changes, then set <code>skipusers="false"</code>,
        and add a <code>&lt;map alias="cvsuser" address="cvsuser@mydomain.com"/&gt;</code>
        element for each user inside the <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> element (replacing
        <code>cvsuser</code> with the real user id and email).</p>

        <p>To get nicely formatted HTML mail you need to use the HTML email
        publisher instead of the plain email publisher. Replace
        <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;htmlemail&gt;</code> and add
        three extra attributes for css, xsldir and logdir. The complete
        <code>&lt;htmlemail&gt;</code> configuration looks like this:</p>


        <pre>&lt;htmlemail mailhost="SMTP_HOST"
        returnaddress="cruise@mydomain.com"
        buildresultsurl="http://localhost/cc/buildresults/MY_PROJECT_1"
        skipusers="true" spamwhilebroken="true"
        css="INSTALL_DIR/reporting/jsp/webcontent/css/cruisecontrol.css"
        xsldir="INSTALL_DIR/reporting/jsp/webcontent/xsl"
        logdir="logs/MY_PROJECT_1"&gt;
    &lt;always address="dev1@mydomain.com"/&gt;
    &lt;always address="dev2@mydomain.com"/&gt;
    &lt;failure address="failed-builds@mydomain.com"/&gt;
&lt;/htmlemail&gt;</pre>


        <h2><a name="Running_the_Reporting_Application">Running the Reporting
        Application</a></h2>

        <h3><a name="Installing_the_Web_Application">Installing the Reporting Application</a></h3>

        <p>The CruiseControl Reporting Application is distributed as a J2EE web
        application archive (war) file, which can be found at
        <code>INSTALL_DIR/reporting/jsp/dist/cruisecontrol.war</code>.</p>

        <p>It should be possible to install cruisecontrol.war on any J2EE
        Servlet Container. However, each container will has its own
        steps for installing the war. For example, using <a class="external"
        href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>, one way to install
        the war is to stop Tomcat, copy cruisecontrol.war to the directory
        <code>TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</code>, and then restart Tomcat. This will
        automatically extract and deploy the contents of the war.</p>

        <p>Once the Reporting Application has been deployed, the Web Application
        Deployment Descriptor (<code>web.xml</code>) must be edited to
        allow the Reporting Application to find the CruiseControl log files and
        build artifacts.</p>

        <p>Open the deployment descriptor from within the deployed location (for
        example, <code>TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/cruisecontrol/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>).
        The following two parameters will have to be modified as
        follows (make sure you replace <code>WORK_DIR</code> with the real
        working directory):</p>

        <pre>&lt;param-name&gt;logDir&lt;/param-name&gt;
&lt;param-value&gt;WORK_DIR/logs&lt;/param-value&gt;</pre>

        <pre>&lt;param-name&gt;rootDir&lt;/param-name&gt;
&lt;param-value&gt;WORK_DIR/artifacts&lt;/param-value&gt;</pre>

        <p>Restart the Servlet Container and test the Reporting Application by
        opening a web browser and navigating to:</p>

        <pre>http://localhost:8080/cruisecontrol/index.jsp</pre>

        <h3><a name="Getting_the_Build_Artifacts_Link_Working">Getting the
        Build Artifacts Link Working</a></h3>

        <p>By using the artifacts publisher, together with the artifacts link in
        the Reporting Application, CruiseControl can provide access to
        historical build output, test results and other important build
        artifacts.</p>

        <p>Add an <code>&lt;artifactspublisher&gt;</code> element to the
        <code>&lt;publishers&gt;</code> element of your config.xml, which
        publishes the desired build artifact(s) to a timestamped directory under
        the <code>WORK_DIR/artifacts</code> directory.</p>

        <pre>&lt;artifactspublisher
    dir="checkout/MY_PROJECT_1/build/output"
    dest="artifacts/MY_PROJECT_1"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>This assumes that you want to publish all files that end up in the
        <code>build/output</code> directory after running the ant build. You can
        also use the <code>file="..."</code> form, but this unfortunately
        creates the entire directory structure under the artifacts dir, just to
        get the single file. Probably a better approach would be to modify your
        CruiseControl build to first copy the build artifacts to a common
        temporary location, so that your config file doesn't have to contain the
        path to the actual files in the checked-out project.</p>

        <h2><a name="Modifying_the_HTML_Reports">Modifying the HTML Reports</a></h2>

        <p>The output you see in the Reporting Application, and the HTML emails,
        is the result of applying a number of XSLT stylesheets to the single XML
        build report that cruise creates. You can see these reports in your
        <code>WORK_DIR/logs</code> directory.</p>

        <p>By default, the log report is formatted like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;cruisecontrol&gt;
    &lt;modifications&gt;
        (contains details of CVS changes since last build)
    &lt;/modifications&gt;
    &lt;info&gt;
        (contains project details)
    &lt;/info&gt;
    &lt;build&gt;
        (the XML output from ant)
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/cruisecontrol&gt;</pre>

        <p>The header message you see on the web page is generated by an XSL
        stylesheet that reads the <code>&lt;info&gt;</code> element, and the
        "Modifications since last build" section is built by a stylesheet that
        uses the <code>&lt;modifications&gt;</code> element.</p>

        <p>Various XSLT stylesheets are provided with the CruiseControl
        distribution, located in <code>INSTALL_DIR/reporting/jsp/webcontent/xsl</code>
        These include:</p>

        <table class="documentation">
            <tr>

        <h2><a name="Merging_Other_XML_Files_into_the_Logfile">Merging Other XML
        Files into the Logfile</a></h2>

        <p>In order for the "unittests" and "checkstyle" reports to work, you
        need to tell CruiseControl to merge the separate XML log files generated
        by <code>&lt;junit&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;checkstyle&gt;</code> into
        your main CruiseControl log file. This is done by adding a
        <code>&lt;merge&gt;</code> element to your <code>&lt;log&gt;</code>
        element in the config file.</p>

        <pre>&lt;!-- directory to write build logs to --&gt;
&lt;log logdir="logs/MY_PROJECT_1"&gt;
    &lt;merge dir="checkout/MY_PROJECT_1/build/junit-reports/"/&gt;
&lt;/log&gt;</pre>

        <p>Note that you can have CruiseControl include a report from
        <code>&lt;junitreport&gt;</code> by using the file attribute (that is,
        <code>&lt;merge file="..."/&gt;</code>).</p>

        <p>Once again, it may be better to copy any required files to a common
        temporary location in your build file, rather than coding the path to
        your checked out project in the config file.</p>

        <p>After doing this, the checkstyle report should appear in the
        Reporting Application and HTML emails. The report only shows up if there
        are checkstyle warnings/errors in the merged report. The same mechanism
        can be used to provide unit test reports, and any other reports you care
        to code up in XSLT.</p>
